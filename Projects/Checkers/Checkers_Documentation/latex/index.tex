 Checkers (also known as Draughts) is a two person strategy game where players compete against each other by moving along a diagonal axis, capturing each others pieces by jumping over them. The object of the game is to capture all the opponents game pieces or block them from being able to make any valid moves. The game is played on an 8 x 8 grid with alternating white and black squares across each row. The game checkers is what is called a solved game, which means that a particular game's outcome can be predicted from any position granted both players play with optimum strategy. Checkers A\-Is like Chinook can play better than the top ranked human players.
