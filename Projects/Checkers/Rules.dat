	Checkers, also known as Draughts, is a two person strategy game where 
players compete against each other by moving along a diagonal axis, capturing 
each others pieces by jumping over them. The object of the game is to capture 
all the opponents game pieces or block them from being able to make any valid 
moves. The game is played on an 8 x 8 grid with alternating white and black 
squares across each row
